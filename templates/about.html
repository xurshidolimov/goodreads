    When I was in second grade, I discovered
    the Hardy Boys series. Ever since, I've
    loved to read — both for fun and to improve
    my mind. And I'm always looking for the next
    great book. One afternoon while I was scanning
    a friend s bookshelf for ideas, it struck me:
    when I want to know what books to read, I'd
    rather turn to a friend than any random person
    or bestseller list.
    So I decided to build a website – a place where
    I could see my friends' bookshelves and learn
    about what they thought of all their books.
    Elizabeth, my co-founder (and now my wife) wrote
    the site copy and I wrote the code. We started in
    my living room, motivated by the belief that there
    was a better way to discover and discuss good books,
    and that we could build it. Goodreads is that site.
    It is a place where you can see what your friends
    are reading and vice versa. You can create
    "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or
    want to read). You can comment on each other's
    reviews. You can find your next favorite book.
    And on this journey with your friends you can
    e/xplore new territory, gather information,
    and expand your mind. Knowledge is power,
    and power is best shared among readers.
